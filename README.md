With no coding background I used a combination of Replit, Cursor AI and www.grok.com to build a modern, clean, AI-powered wedding planning project management tool for brides. It helps them track all aspects of wedding planning from tasks, budget, guest list, seating charts, vendor data, contracts, some images, store attachments and provide personalized AI suggestions. UI was inspired by Stripe Atlas, Asana, and Slack. About 70% complete. Web application (no mobile app) will be a subscription based model where each user has their own account. 

Looking for a full stack developer to finalize the remaining 30% in the coming weeks.

Opportunity for ongoing role to maintain and scale this tool if project completed well.

Core Features:
A chatbot-style interface that answers questions, suggests vendors, generates timelines, and offers ideas
Task tracker with customizable tasks and deadlines, auto-populated based on wedding date and AI suggestions.
-Tracks expenses across categories (venue, catering, attire, etc.), alerts users when nearing budget limits, and suggests cost-saving tips.
-A searchable list of local vendors (venues, florists, etc.) with ratings, powered by AI recommendations based on user preferences.
-Auto-generates a wedding planning timeline (e.g., “9 months out: Book venue”) based on wedding date and adjusts as tasks are completed.
CRUD for wedding planning data
store attachments such as contracts and some images
